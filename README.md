### Feature Overview

This web app is designed as a toolkit for midi-guitar playalong and reharmonization ðŸŒŸ 

Both the fretboard and midi note editor components render through a custom webgl2 implementation. The motivation for making a WebGL2 render engine came from the need for a simple to impliment midi editor component that doesn't rely on HTML Divs for each rectangle, as with larger midi files this becomes unstable and resource heavy. 

Try it out with this midi file: [Debussy: Arabesque](https://github.com/audreyadora/harmony/blob/9bd184101be2895db87d364ca5297d4de0dbe762/static/arabesqu.mid)

The interface is designed to be as intuitive as possible. All aspects of the fretboard including scale length and string count are controllable with the settings in the left sidebar. All sections of the app can be resized at the dividers. The center section is a simple text endpoint listing the selected notes in order.

To do: 
-implement mac-friendly keyboard shortcuts.

-add midi and fretboard audio playback 
-centralize surface-layer UI state management: 
  presently the app will prioritize selected notes on piano roll, and you need to deselect notes to be able to change the marker stylings for the   non-selected intervals
